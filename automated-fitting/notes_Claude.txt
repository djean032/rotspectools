* Autocorrelations
   * autocorrelation to detect impurities
   * how to check?
    * isotopic sub?
      - tried with Ketene,
    * start with pure isomers

* Use SPFIT or NO?
  * polynomial fit for series?
  * use series to reduce likelihood of collisions with intense vibrational states
  * combination differences?
